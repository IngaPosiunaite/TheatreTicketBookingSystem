<h4> Theatre Booking System


<h5>The project was to create a new booking system for The Theatre Royal. Java and MySQL were used to create the project. 
  
<h5>The user Interface is text-based using the console. The theatre offers information regarding forthcoming shows, and allows people to purchase performance tickets online.

<h5>The application let users browse shows/performances, search for specific shows or dates, select a number of tickets for show(s) for purchase, and to complete their purchase of those tickets. The interface ensure that users of the application can find the following information for any show:
<h5>• The title of the show 
<h5>• The type of show (theatre, musical, opera, concert)
<h5>• A description 
<h5>• When performances of the show are staged
<h5>• The duration of a performance 
<h5>• The price of tickets for a performance 
<h5>• The availability of tickets for a performance.

<h5>The theatre has 200 seats, all of which are available for any performance. These are split between the stalls (120 seats) and the circle (80 seats); currently the theatre charges the same amount for seats in the stalls and seats in the circle for a performance.
